My interest in graphic design began when I was in middle school (ca. 2012-2013). Me and my friends were heavily invested in playing Minecraft together and I had ambitions to become a YouTuber like any other twelve-year-old kid at the time. I decided to start up a channel, but I needed a logo and art to create a brand. I downloaded GIMP and sat down to teach myself the ropes. Within 3 years, I had a pretty good grasp of the program and even made art for my friends and family at the time. Once I entered high school in 2015, I upgraded to Adobe Photoshop and haven’t looked back since.

Around the same time, I became interested in web design and how websites worked. I remember my first foray into web development beginning with learning Adobe Dreamweaver and making simple sites for myself and my friends. After around 2 years of that, I began to learn basic HTML and CSS and started to develop my own static websites. Over the course of a decade, I’ve honed my skills in web development and learned many different frameworks and programming languages, but my skills in HTML and CSS have never wavered. For example, I still prefer to design my websites using hand-made CSS rather than frameworks or libraries like Bootstrap or Tailwind.

My ideology around web development is based in simplicity and accessibility: using semantic elements when possible and design schemes that appear interesting, but follow common <abbr title="accessibility">a11y</abbr> guidelines. Accessibility and usability should never be compromised for design or ease of development.

My inspiration for design is rooted in minimalism and abstract forms. I love bold, yet limited color palettes and experimenting with form and composition. However, I’ve never been one to stay in a box, so my design tastes evolve over time based on what is tickling my fancy in that moment.
