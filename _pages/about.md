### About Me
Hello, my name is Zachary and I am a amateur graphic designer, web developer, programmer, gamer, and many more things that would take too much space to list. I am 22 years old (born on the 14th of January, 2001) and my pronouns are `he/him/his`.

My interest in graphic design began when I was in middle school (ca. 2012-2013). Me and my friends were heavily invested in playing Minecraft together and I had ambitions to become a YouTuber like any other twelve-year-old kid at the time. I decided to start up a channel, but I needed a logo and art to create a brand. I downloaded GIMP and sat down to teach myself the ropes. Within 3 years, I had a pretty good grasp of the program and even made art for my friends and family at the time. Once I entered high school in 2015, I upgraded to Adobe Photoshop and haven't looked back since.

Around the same time, I became interested in web design and how websites worked. I remember my first foray into web development beginning with learning Adobe Dreamweaver and making simple sites for myself and my friends. After around 2 years of that, I began to learn basic HTML and CSS and started to develop my own static websites. Over the course of a decade, I've honed my skills in web development and learned many different frameworks and programming languages, but my skills in HTML and CSS have never wavered. For example, I still prefer to design my websites using hand-made CSS rather than frameworks or libraries like Bootstrap or Tailwind.

My ideology around web development is based in simplicity and accessibility: using semantic elements when possible and design schemes that appear interesting, but follow common a11y guidelines. Accessibility and usability should **never** be compromised for design or ease of development.

My inspiration for design is rooted in minimalism and abstract forms. I love bold, yet limited color palettes and experimenting with form and composition. However, I've never been one to stay in a box, so my design tastes evolve over time based on what is tickling my fancy in that moment.

### Now
Right now, I'm working at a full-time remote data entry job and have been doing so since November of 2021, which leaves me with little time to pursue projects and client work. My work picks up from the end of December to around April, so it'll be a bit before I'll have more time.
