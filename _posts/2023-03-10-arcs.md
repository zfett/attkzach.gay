It's amazing the circumstances in which a collaboration can come to fruition. What started as a passing mention while waiting for a Rocket League match later became one of my most fun projects to date.

In April of 2021, I was in a call with a friend of mine and front-man of rabidgrounds, Michael. We originally called to hop in a game of Rocket League when our conversation turned to music. We talked about their debut self-titled album and the band's future when ideas for a new album/project came to mention. The details were sparse but the vision was there. After a couple of months pass, the guys come to me to finally get started on the ideation phase for cover art of their upcoming project, "Arcs".

The first concept, being first presented in June of 2021, was rough. I was given a simple outline of how "Arcs" was to be conceptualized: a collection of stories and ideas groups by a theme. My initial design was to reflect this, albeit literally:

In this concept, the four thematic divisions were obviously portrayed. Each theme would have its own quadrant, complete with an "orb" and an icon representing one of the four elements: earth, air, water, and fire. The accompanying colors for these quadrants were to also match. This, as mentioned prior, was way too on the nose for the band and I had to agree. Later conversations led to the dropping of the "elemental" theme for the project.

In a second call, Michael, Brendan (also front-man), and I were discussing genre ideas for the album art, which led to Michael and I finding impressionist abstract art on Google Images, like Juan Gris' "Head of a Woman":

This was an immediate "lightbulb" moment for us. We knew upon seeing this art that this was the style we were to pursue for the project. In no time, Brendan sketched out a drawing of an abstract, distorted face with enough space in the corners to keep with our "quadrants" motif:

The color choice was a bold one. One that would later be abandoned for a more consistent and muted palette. Eventually, we decided that instead of sticking with a digital trace of the original sketch, we'd combine the two, using the digital trace to "beef up" the sketch's line art.

Brendan and I eventually split off into a separate call to discuss more conceptual ideas for the art, which is when Brendan gave a quick guide for the more abstract ideas of the composition:

After significant revisions, we are getting ever closer to the final design. The colors are still not near their final form, but the composition is near-finished:

Notable additions are the "RG" lettering in the earring of the figure, and the "Arcs" wording on the tongue. After some days of letting this all air out, Sydney: graphic designer and artist, plus partner of Michael, gives some feedback on the colors, providing a color palette to use as a basis for what will eventually become the final revision of the project. I decided to do a simple gradient map to change the old colors to the new, which gave me this:

These changes were made live in a Discord call. Upon seeing these new colors, Michael, Brendan, Sydney, and I were immediately sure that this was a *very* good decision. I also decided to make an inverted colors version for a B-sides, deluxe edition, or some other form of special release:

The journey from ideation to finalization was one of the longest, yet most rewarding I've ever experienced and may ever experience. Working with a talented group of multi-faceted musicians and artists resulted in one of the most enriching processes an artist could experience. The constant bouncing of ideas, discussions of themes and motifs, and sharing of revisions resulted in a piece of art that I can confidently present to the world, with no regrets to be noted.

This entire project, from first concept to final revision, occurred over a period of twelve days, from the 27th of June to the 8th of July, 2021. However, including initial conversations up to finalization, the total runs to a little over four months. One of the longest-running projects I've been involved in, but I would do it again in a heartbeat if asked.

I want to give my deepest thanks to Michael Allen and Brendan Clay of rabidgrounds for providing me the opportunity to work with them on "Arcs" and not immediately ghosting me upon seeing the initial concept art. I would also like to thank Sydney Hughes for her sage design advice and color recommendations.
