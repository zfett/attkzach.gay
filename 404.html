<h2>Fun Fact</h2>
<p>The first documented case of a 404 error being seen on a website was in 1993 when a user tried to access the Mosaic web browser page on the NCSA's website. The page had been moved to another location but the link remained unchanged. Once this was reported to the NCSA team, they fixed the broken link and added a funny message to their site's 404 page: "We're sorry, but the document you requested is not here. Maybe you should try someplace else."<sup>1</sup></p>
